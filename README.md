# LosChat
LosChat is a toy chatting application written with TCP protocol, PostgreSQL and Java, which was my coursework of Software Workshop in 2020. I wrote this project with my Team members Wenbin Hu, Yan Wang, Yongqi Han and Zongshi Li. Thanks for their contributions.

This project was UNFINISHED and STOPPED before testing, which means it may contains some bugs in different parts.

We have built the most of functions of this assginment project, including:

- [ ] Register a new account
- [ ] Log in/Log out
- [ ] Change your password
- [ ] Get the information of current account
- [ ] Chat with your friend
- [ ] Create a new group
- [ ] Chat with your group members
